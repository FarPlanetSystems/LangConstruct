in any formal languages, you will really need to be careful with spaces inbetween, for instances
the following statements are not equivalent:

aaab;
aaab ;
 aaab;


def [zero belong Natural];
def [one belong Natural];
rule equiv (x) : [x belongs Natural] > {x = x};
rule sum_1 (x, y) : [x belong Natural] , [y belong Natural] > {x + y belong Natural};

have {one = one} from equiv (one) [one belong Natural];
have {one + one belong Natural} from sum_1 (one,one) : [one belong Natural] , [one belong Natural];
