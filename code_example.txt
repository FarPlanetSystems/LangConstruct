in any formal languages, you will really need to be careful with spaces inbetween, for instances
the following statements are not equivalent:

aaab;
aaab ;
 aaab;

the actual example:

#simple resemblance of Peano's axioms. Of cource they are not going to work properly without a first-order logic and its grammar. Just look around

def "zero belong Natural";
def "one belong Natural";


rule equiv (x) : -> "[x] = [x]";
rule sum1 (x, y) : "[x] belong Natural" , "[y] belong Natural" -> "[x] + [y] belong Natural";

have "one = one" from equiv (one);
have "one + one belong Natural" from sum1 (one, one) "one belong Natural" , "one belong Natural";
